# Project map

Where things are in Pi Pocket, for agents working on it. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) has the rules for editing it while it runs; [features.md](features.md) says what each feature does.

## Processes

`bin/pi-pocket.js` checks Node, then runs `src/launcher/main.ts`. The launcher asks how devices connect (`access.ts`: this device, LAN, Cloudflare quick tunnel, Tailscale), runs the server (`src/server/main.ts`) as a child, restarts it on exit code 75 or a crash, and keeps the tunnel up. The server opens one `PocketApp` and serves it with `http.ts`.

## Data (`~/.pi-pocket/`, or `PI_POCKET_DIR`)

- `pocket.sqlite`: Pi Durable's storage: conversations, entries, tasks, and Pi Pocket's documents.
- `config.json`: people, roles, hashed tokens, settings. `push.json`: VAPID keys and push subscriptions.
- `uploads/<conversation>/`, `worktrees/` (sessions' git worktrees), `extensions/` (the owner's drop-ins), `browser/profile/` (the built-in browser's profile; each session's cookies live in memory only).

## Server: `src/server/`

`chief.ts` owns the owner → Chief home identity, current-requester cross-session operations, and the background `pocket.chief-report` task installed by core. Stored document/task names retain their contracts: `ChiefsDoc` and `ChiefMessagesDoc` hold identity/creation/archive receipts and explicit message reporters; `ScheduleReceiptsDoc` preserves keyed schedule receipts after firing or cancellation. `POST /api/chief` opens the owner’s singleton. Session tools are global; the Chief-only extension marker selects coordinator role instructions, not extra authority. Every service call uses existing requester access checks. Completion reports return to the originating conversation as unattributed write-only entries, without changing its current requester or automatically waking its model. The owner drop-in `~/.pi-pocket/extensions/sessions.ts` provides shared tools; `extensions/chief.ts` supplies only role instructions. The wrapper depends only on the existing `PocketHost.chief` service, not checkout imports. Removing it leaves core `pocket.chief-report` tasks and schedules intact.

## Extensions: `src/server/extensions/`

Each default-exports `(host: PocketHost) => Extension | Extension[]` and is installed in this order: `prompt` (system prompt), `artifacts` (artifact tool), `browser` (browser tool and its prompt section; through `host.browsers`), `subagents` (subagent tool and its tasks), `schedules` (schedule tool; installs the schedule task), `chief` (coordinator role instructions), `goals` (hook after each answer), `plan` (tool hook and prompt section), `guard` (tool hook that asks for approval), `codemode` (codemode tool; a script's calls go through the same hooks). Enabled owner drop-ins load afterward, including `sessions.ts` for global session tools and context-reference guidance.

## How a message travels

1. `POST /api/c/:id/submit` → `commands.submit`: checks access, turns, and spend, expands a template, then `conversation.submit()` with request id `u:<userId>:<clientId>`. The request id makes a retry a no-op and names the author.
2. Pi Durable runs the generation and tool tasks, committing each step to `pocket.sqlite`. Extension hooks run inside those tasks.
3. `app.ts`'s commit listener hears every commit: it records authors, tracks busy conversations and spend, and tells the rooms.
4. Each room sends its tabs what changed. `store.js` applies it, and Preact renders.

## Adding things

- **A document:** define it in `docs.ts`. To show it live, add it to `ROOM_DOCS` and the view in `room.ts`, and read it in `store.js`.
- **A command:** a method in `commands.ts` (check access first), a route in `http.ts`, an action in `store.js`, then the UI.
- **A built-in extension:** a file in `extensions/`, its place in `ORDER` and its title in `TITLES` (`reload.ts`), and the order asserted in `test/app.test.ts`.
- **A slash command:** `web/commands.js`.

## Rules that are easy to break

- Browsers only see committed state. Nothing is shown before it is stored.
- Document kinds, scopes, and fork settings are stored data: never change them.
- Hooks get only `memo` and `snapshot`. Anything a replay must not repeat goes in a memo or behind an idempotent request id.
- Whose work Pi does comes from request ids (`requests.ts`): a message sent for someone needs their id in its request id, or it counts as nobody's. At startup, what a crash kept out of the authors document is read back from Pi Durable's records.
- A tool is `replay: "safe"` only if running it twice is harmless.
- Extensions reach the app only through `PocketHost`.
- Server code is erasable TypeScript with `.ts` imports. Comments are plain sentences.

## Tests: `test/`

`npm test` runs every `*.test.ts` with Node's test runner. `helpers.ts` provides a scripted model (`scriptedModel(route)`: `faux-1`, `faux-2`, `faux-vision`), `openApp` (the same data folder again is a restart; `now` moves the clock), `newSession`, `say`, `until`, and `fakeTab`. The scripted model costs nothing: spend tests write `pi.usage` themselves. Owner sessions integration tests use the installed drop-in through the native loader (`test/owner-sessions.ts`); set `PI_POCKET_SESSIONS_EXTENSION` to another copy to verify it. Without that optional module, those tests skip rather than keeping a built-in wrapper copy. There are no tests of the web app; `browser.test.ts` drives a real Chromium, where one is installed, for the built-in browser.
